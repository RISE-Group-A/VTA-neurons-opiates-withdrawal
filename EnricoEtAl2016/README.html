<p>We used a biophysical computational model of dopamine (DA) neuron of
the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of the rat to clarify how morphine
withdrawal-induced neurochemical and morphological changes could
affect the electrophysiological behavior of these neurons. The model
findings suggest how and to what extent a change in the balance of
GABA/GLU inputs can take into account the experimentally observed
hypofunction of VTA DA neurons during acute and prolonged withdrawal,
whereas morphological changes may play a role in the increased
excitability of VTA DA cell to opiate administration observed during
opiate withdrawal.

<ol>
  <li>Opiates withdrawal inhibits mesolimbic dopaminergic activity and
dopamine release
  </li><li>These effects can be described using a biophysically plausible
computational model
  </li><li>A specific GABA/GLU input imbalance reproduces withdrawal effects
on dopamine cells
  </li><li>Morphological changes may influence response to morphine of
dopamine cells
  </li><li>Down-regulation of GLU inputs may explain post-withdrawal
hypodopaminergic state

<p>The model was written in NEURON which is required and freely available

<p>The simulation file DA_release_final.hoc can be used to reproduce the traces in Fig.2a,
2b, and 2c of the paper
</p>
<p>To start the simulation:
</p>
<p>If NEURON is installed and your browser is properly configured you can
auto-launch the model directly from the modeldb entry (click the
auto-launch button) which starts mosinit.hoc automatically after
compiling the mod files.  mosinit.hoc is configured to run
DA_release_final.hoc
</p>
<p>After a brief time you should see figures that includes one similar to
figure 2 (middle) in the paper:
</p>
<p><img src="./screenshot.png" alt="fig2b" width="550">
</p>
  If instead you run DA_release_withdrawal_final_noGLU.hoc you will get a corresponding result
  to what is indicated in Fig 3D -50 Glu

</p>
<p>---<br/>
Under unix systems:
</p>
<p>Compile the mod files use the command "nrnivmodl" and run one of the
simulations with the command: nrngui filename
</p>
<p>---<br/>
Under Windows systems:
</p>
<p>Compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on one of the simulation files will open the simulation
window.
</p>
<p>---<br/>
Under MAC OS X:
</p>
<p>Drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon. Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc onto the nrngui icon.
